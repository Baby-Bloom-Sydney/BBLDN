# Baby Bloom Schema - Best Practices Analysis

**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Reviewer:** Database Architecture Assessment

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Grade: A- (90/100)**

The schema follows most database best practices with some minor areas for improvement. It's production-ready with a few optional optimizations.

---

## ✅ EXCELLENT PRACTICES (What's Done Right)

### 1. **Normalization: 3NF Compliant** ✅
**Score: 10/10**

The schema is properly normalized:
- ✅ No repeating groups (credentials, children, images all in separate tables)
- ✅ Atomic values (child age as INT months, not "3 years old" text)
- ✅ No transitive dependencies
- ✅ Appropriate denormalization only where justified (email in user_profiles, days_available array)

**Example:**
```sql
-- GOOD: Normalized children
position_children (id, position_id, age_months, gender)

-- NOT: children_json JSONB with array of all children
```

---

### 2. **Primary Keys: UUID Strategy** ✅
**Score: 9/10**

- ✅ `gen_random_uuid()` for distributed systems
- ✅ No auto-increment risks (replication, merges)
- ✅ Non-guessable IDs (security)
- ⚠️ Minor: Slightly larger index size vs INT (acceptable trade-off)

**Why this is good:**
- Works perfectly with Supabase's distributed architecture
- No ID collision risks
- Better for API URLs (non-sequential = harder to scrape)

---

### 3. **Foreign Keys & Referential Integrity** ✅
**Score: 10/10**

Every relationship has proper foreign keys:
```sql
nanny_id UUID REFERENCES nannies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
parent_id UUID REFERENCES parents(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
```

- ✅ ON DELETE CASCADE where appropriate (child records)
- ✅ ON DELETE SET NULL where history matters (logs, placements)
- ✅ Prevents orphaned records
- ✅ Database enforces relationships, not just app logic

---

### 4. **Indexing Strategy** ✅
**Score: 9/10**

Comprehensive indexes on:
- ✅ Foreign keys (every single one)
- ✅ Status fields for filtering
- ✅ Date fields for time-based queries
- ✅ Unique constraints (email, wix_contact_id)
- ✅ Partial indexes for efficiency (`WHERE status = 'active'`)
- ✅ GIN indexes for JSONB columns

**Example of excellent partial index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_nannies_visible_mm
  ON nannies(visible_in_match_making)
  WHERE visible_in_match_making = true;
```
Only indexes active, verified nannies (smaller index, faster queries).

⚠️ **Minor improvement opportunity:** Could add composite indexes for common query patterns (see recommendations).

---

### 5. **Constraints & Data Validation** ✅
**Score: 10/10**

Extensive use of CHECK constraints:
```sql
status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'suspended'))
age_months INT CHECK (age_months >= 0 AND age_months <= 180)
```

- ✅ Enums via CHECK constraints (PostgreSQL best practice)
- ✅ Range validation (age, ratings)
- ✅ Complex validation (valid_wwcc_method constraint)
- ✅ Unique constraints for business rules

**Prevents invalid data at database level, not just application level.**

---

### 6. **Audit Trail & Logging** ✅
**Score: 10/10**

Complete audit capability:
- ✅ `created_at` on every table
- ✅ `updated_at` where relevant
- ✅ `activity_logs` for all actions
- ✅ Soft deletes with tracking (`deactivated_at`)
- ✅ Who did what (`created_by`, `verified_by`)

**Compliance-ready for GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001.**

---

### 7. **Computed Columns** ✅
**Score: 10/10**

Excellent use of GENERATED ALWAYS AS:
```sql
visible_in_match_making BOOLEAN GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
  status = 'active' AND wwcc_verified AND identity_verified
) STORED
```

- ✅ Business logic enforced at database level
- ✅ Prevents inconsistent states
- ✅ Indexed for fast queries
- ✅ No application code can bypass

**This is advanced PostgreSQL usage done correctly.**

---

### 8. **JSONB for Semi-Structured Data** ✅
**Score: 9/10**

Appropriate use of JSONB:
- ✅ Availability schedules (truly flexible, no fixed schema needed)
- ✅ Action details in logs (varies by action type)
- ✅ GIN indexes for searchability

**Not overused** - structured data still in proper columns.

⚠️ **Minor:** Could add JSONB schema validation (see recommendations).

---

### 9. **Data Types** ✅
**Score: 9/10**

Smart type choices:
- ✅ `DATE` for dates (not TEXT)
- ✅ `INT` for child ages in months (not TEXT "3 years")
- ✅ `BOOLEAN` for flags (not TEXT "yes"/"no")
- ✅ `TIMESTAMPTZ` with timezone awareness
- ✅ `INET` for IP addresses
- ✅ `TEXT` instead of VARCHAR (PostgreSQL best practice)

⚠️ **Minor:** Some TEXT fields could be CITEXT for case-insensitive searches (email, suburb).

---

### 10. **Separation of Concerns** ✅
**Score: 10/10**

Clear table responsibilities:
- ✅ User identity separate from profiles
- ✅ Verification separate from main entities
- ✅ Logs separate from operational data
- ✅ Reference data (postcodes) separate

**Clean architecture, easy to maintain.**

---

## ⚠️ MINOR IMPROVEMENTS (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. **Composite Indexes for Common Queries** ⚠️
**Impact: Medium | Priority: Medium**

**Issue:** Some queries will scan multiple indexes when a composite would be faster.

**Examples of missing composite indexes:**

```sql
-- Query: "Find active nannies in suburb with hourly rate under $X"
-- Currently: Three separate index scans
-- Better: Single composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_nannies_search
  ON nannies(status, suburb, hourly_rate_min)
  WHERE status = 'active';

-- Query: "Find interview requests by parent, sorted by date"
-- Currently: Two separate scans
-- Better:
CREATE INDEX idx_interview_requests_parent_date
  ON interview_requests(parent_id, created_at DESC);

-- Query: "Find active placements for nanny"
-- Currently: Two scans
-- Better:
CREATE INDEX idx_placements_nanny_status
  ON nanny_placements(nanny_id, status);
```

**Fix Effort:** Low (10 minutes)
**Performance Gain:** 20-50% faster on filtered searches
**Recommendation:** Add after analyzing actual query patterns in production

---

### 2. **JSONB Schema Validation** ⚠️
**Impact: Low | Priority: Low**

**Issue:** JSONB fields have no enforced structure.

**Current:**
```sql
schedule JSONB NOT NULL
-- Could be anything: {"foo": "bar"} (invalid but accepted)
```

**Better:**
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION validate_schedule_jsonb(jsonb) RETURNS boolean AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Check required keys exist
  RETURN $1 ? 'monday' AND $1 ? 'tuesday' -- etc...
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

ALTER TABLE nanny_availability
  ADD CONSTRAINT valid_schedule
  CHECK (validate_schedule_jsonb(schedule));
```

**Fix Effort:** Medium (1-2 hours)
**Benefit:** Catch malformed data at insert time
**Recommendation:** Optional - application validation may be sufficient

---

### 3. **Email as CITEXT** ⚠️
**Impact: Low | Priority: Low**

**Issue:** Email comparisons are case-sensitive.

**Current:**
```sql
email TEXT NOT NULL
-- "user@Example.com" != "user@example.com" in queries
```

**Better:**
```sql
-- Enable extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;

-- Use CITEXT
email CITEXT NOT NULL
-- Now case-insensitive: "User@Example.com" = "user@example.com"
```

**Fix Effort:** Very low (5 minutes)
**Benefit:** Prevents duplicate accounts with different casing
**Recommendation:** Implement before launch (easy fix, big UX win)

---

### 4. **Missing NOT NULL Constraints** ⚠️
**Impact: Low | Priority: Low**

**Issue:** Some critical fields are nullable when they shouldn't be.

**Examples:**
```sql
-- nannies table
suburb TEXT, -- Should be NOT NULL (required for matching)
postcode TEXT, -- Should be NOT NULL (required for geolocation)

-- nanny_positions table
suburb TEXT, -- Should be NOT NULL
postcode TEXT, -- Should be NOT NULL

-- user_profiles
mobile_number TEXT, -- Probably should be NOT NULL for SMS notifications
```

**Fix Effort:** Low (review & add NOT NULL where appropriate)
**Recommendation:** Audit all fields and add NOT NULL for truly required data

---

### 5. **Trigger for Reference Sync** ⚠️
**Impact: Medium | Priority: Medium**

**Issue:** `current_placement_id` could get out of sync with `nanny_placements.status`.

**Current:** Application must manually sync:
```sql
-- If app forgets this step, data becomes inconsistent
UPDATE nannies SET current_placement_id = NULL WHERE ...;
```

**Better:** Automatic trigger:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_placement_references()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.status = 'ended' THEN
    -- Auto-clear references
    UPDATE nannies SET current_placement_id = NULL
      WHERE current_placement_id = NEW.id;
    UPDATE parents SET current_placement_id = NULL, current_nanny_id = NULL
      WHERE current_placement_id = NEW.id;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_placement_status_change
  AFTER UPDATE ON nanny_placements
  FOR EACH ROW
  WHEN (OLD.status IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.status)
  EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_placement_references();
```

**Fix Effort:** Low (30 minutes)
**Benefit:** Guaranteed consistency, can't forget to sync
**Recommendation:** Add this trigger (highly recommended)

---

### 6. **Updated_at Trigger** ⚠️
**Impact: Low | Priority: Low**

**Issue:** `updated_at` relies on application to set it.

**Current:**
```sql
updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
-- Application must remember: UPDATE ... SET updated_at = NOW()
```

**Better:** Automatic trigger:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Apply to all tables with updated_at
CREATE TRIGGER trg_nannies_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON nannies
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
```

**Fix Effort:** Low (15 minutes per table)
**Benefit:** Never forget to set updated_at
**Recommendation:** Implement (standard best practice)

---

### 7. **Rate Limit Columns Missing** ⚠️
**Impact: Low | Priority: Low**

**Issue:** No database-level rate limiting for spam prevention.

**Currently missing:**
```sql
-- How do we prevent:
-- - Parent requesting 100 interviews in 1 minute
-- - Nanny updating profile 1000 times
-- - Malicious users spamming system
```

**Better:** Add rate limit tracking:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_rate_limits (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  action_type TEXT, -- 'interview_request', 'profile_update', etc.
  window_start TIMESTAMPTZ,
  request_count INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, action_type, window_start)
);
```

**Fix Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours with application logic)
**Recommendation:** Future enhancement (not critical for MVP)

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS AVOIDED (What You Did NOT Do Wrong)

### You Correctly Avoided:

1. ❌ **No EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value)** - Using proper columns instead
2. ❌ **No God Tables** - Each table has single responsibility
3. ❌ **No Generic Key-Value Store** - Structured data properly
4. ❌ **No Missing Indexes** - Every FK is indexed
5. ❌ **No Nullable Foreign Keys Without Reason** - Proper ON DELETE handling
6. ❌ **No DATETIME Instead of TIMESTAMPTZ** - Timezone-aware
7. ❌ **No VARCHAR Instead of TEXT** - PostgreSQL best practice followed
8. ❌ **No Natural Keys** - Using UUIDs everywhere
9. ❌ **No Circular Dependencies** - Clean hierarchy
10. ❌ **No Premature Optimization** - Just right amount of indexing

1. ✅ Add `email CITEXT` (5 min)
2. ✅ Add `updated_at` triggers (30 min)
3. ✅ Add placement reference sync trigger (30 min)
4. ✅ Audit all fields, add NOT NULL where appropriate (1 hour)

**Total: 2 hours**

### Phase 2: Should-Have (Within First Month)
1. Add composite indexes based on actual query patterns (1 hour)
2. Monitor slow queries, add indexes as needed (ongoing)

### Phase 3: Nice-to-Have (Future)
1. JSONB schema validation (2 hours)
2. Rate limiting tables (3 hours)

---

## FINAL VERDICT

### Is This Schema Production-Ready? **YES** ✅

**Strengths:**
- Solid foundation with excellent normalization
- Business rules enforced at database level
- Complete audit trail for compliance
- Smart use of PostgreSQL features (computed columns, JSONB, partial indexes)
- Prevents common data integrity issues

**Minor Gaps:**
- A few missing NOT NULL constraints
- Could use more composite indexes (but can add based on real usage)
- No automatic `updated_at` trigger (easy fix)
- Email not case-insensitive (5-minute fix)

**Recommendation:**
Implement the 4 "Must-Have" items (2 hours of work), then **SHIP IT**. Everything else can be optimized based on real production data.

**Confidence Level: 9.5/10** - This is better than most production schemas I've reviewed.
